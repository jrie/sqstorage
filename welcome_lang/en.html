        <h6><a class="headLink" name="basics">Basic introduction</a></h6>
        <p>This text &quot;Basic introduction&quot; is directed at first time users of sqS. In case you are new, there is some basic guide on what you can do.</p>

        <h6>Brief summary</h6>
        <p>In sqS you can easily create storages (areas, rooms, places, chests, cupboards, boxes...), inventories, collections of all kind. For example your movie/game/music/application collection or anything else you like to keep an eye on. <b>It is simple: You name it, sqStorage stores it!</b></p>

        <h6>Basics</h6>
        <p>Going further, you can add items of any kind with basic informations like title/label, amount, comments, serial number, and article numbers as default/basic fields. And also you have the option to make use of item categories and subcategories to further narrow down items.</p>
        <p>To add storages, create a item and input your desired storage name, the storage will then be created and the item will be stored in this storage. If you add another item, you can reselect the storage or create another storage.</p>

        <h6>Extendable and custom data fields</h6>
        <p>But sqS is not limited to that information and can extended by yourself.</p>
        <p>sqS can be extended by your own desired informations, for example if you need &quot;Game keys&quot; or &quot;Serial numbers/keys&quot; you can simply add a custom datafield which stores this information for the category &quot;Games&quot; and also &quot;Applications&quot;. Or you need a buying price, you can add this as a custom field too. The best of it, you can assign for which type or category of items the custom data field refers too. So this information is not presented for categories of items, you do not want the data to be entered or displayed.</p>

        <h6>User system</h6>
        <p>In case you want to secure your sqS installation from other parties, you can do so by enabling a user system. You can add administrators, users and guests - each having there own permissions.</p>
        <p>Basically, administrators can do everything, like creating users. Users are allowed to add, create, delete, items and categories or custom fields. Guest only can view what is stored, they have no other rights what so ever.</p>
